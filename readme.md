This project is a C++ class library that implements the mixin design pattern to allow users to add different ZeroMQ socket functionalities into an object. ZeroMQ is a lightweight messaging library that allows applications to communicate over a variety of transport protocols. By using the mixin pattern, this library enables users to easily extend the functionality of their ZeroMQ sockets without modifying the underlying code. This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in C++, software design patterns, and network programming, and it can be used as a starting point for developing complex messaging systems that require extensible and flexible architectures.
